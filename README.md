# Airdrop Distribution UI

Note: This project is a practice exercise designed to explore and experiment with various Solidity and UI concepts learned through the [Updraft Cyfrin] courses.

Developed a ReactJs application that interacts with a Smart contract that distributes an ERC20 token to a list of addresses.

Technologies used:
  - ReactJs
  - NextJs
  - RainbowKit
  - Wagmi
  - Tailwind CSS
  - TypeScript
  - Playwright + Synpress
  - Vite
  - Fleek
  - pnpm

Repository includes [tsender-deployed.json](./tsender-deployed.json) to be able to run a pre loaded anvil configuration with `pnpm anvil`. The first Anvil address: `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` comes with minted `0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512` ERC20 token.
